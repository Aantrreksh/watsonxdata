# Pausing or Resuming native Spark engine
{: #ps_res_1}

You can pause a Spark engine, which is in running state. Pausing an engine stops the Spark applications in running state and the engine releases the existing capacity. You can also resume a paused engine.

Pause the native Spark engine when not in use to avoid accumulating additional charges. You can resume the engine later. It takes about 15-20 minutes to resume the engine.
