# Associating or dissociating catalogs
{: #ass_nsp}

In IBMÂ® watsonx.data, you can associate (or dissociate an already associated catalog) a catalog with the Native Spark engine.

To associate a catalog with an engine, see [Associating a catalog with an engine](watsonxdata?topic=watsonxdata-asso-cat-eng).

When you associate a catalog with a Spark engine, connection properties for the associated catalog are added to the Spark engine's default configuration. Do not overwrite these properties in default configuration manually.
{: note}

To dissociate a catalog with an engine, see [Dissociating a catalog from an engine](watsonxdata?topic=watsonxdata-disso-cat-eng).
