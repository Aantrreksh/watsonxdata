# Mixed-case behavior
{: #mixed_case_behavior}

From IBMÂ® watsonx.data version 2.0.0, a new feature is available to switch between both case-sensitive and case-insensitive behavior in Presto (Java) by using a mixed-case feature flag. The mixed-case feature flag is set to OFF in Presto (Java) by default. The flag can be set to ON or OFF as required during deployment of the Presto (Java) engine. It is advised not to toggle between ON and OFF configurations after the deployment, as it may result in inconsistent system behavior.

## Mixed-case feature flag: ON
{: #flagon_features}

The following section lists the behaviors of connectors if mixed-case feature flag is set to ON:

   * **General behavior for all connectors**:

     * Column names in the `SELECT` query are case-insensitive.

     * While referencing the data within the `WITH` clause, it is essential to use the exact alias name (case-sensitive) assigned during its definition. Using an incorrect alias triggers the following error message: "Schema must be specified when session schema is not set."


     * For tables that are specified using `WITH` and `USE` catalog.schema clauses, the alias name is case-sensitive. Using an incorrect alias triggers the following error message: "Table does not exist."

   * **Hive**:

     * Column names in the `CREATE TABLE` statement with partition is case-sensitive within a single query.
     * When referencing the data within the `WITH` clause, it is essential to use the alias name in lowercase during its definition.
     * The `CREATE TABLE` statement is case-sensitive within a single query in `WHERE` clause.
     * Table names that are provided in the keywords `WHERE`, `HAVING`, and `GROUP BY` are case-sensitive.

   * **Iceberg**:

     * The `CREATE TABLE` statement is case-sensitive within a single query in `WHERE` clause.
     * Table names provided in the keywords `WHERE`, `HAVING`, and `GROUP BY` are case-sensitive.
     * Column names in the `ALTER table RENAME` and `ALTER table DROP` are case-sensitive and accept only lowercase.

   * **MongoDB**:

     * Column names for `DELETE` statement are case-insensitive.

   * **Teradata**:

     * Tables with duplicate names cannot be created, regardless of the case.

   * **IBM **{{site.data.keyword.netezza_short}}****:

     * Tables with the same name and case cannot exist in multiple schemas that have the same name but different cases.

   * **Informix**:

     * Table and column names are stored in lowercase, regardless of the case specified.

   * **Delta Lake**:

     * Schema name in `SELECT` statement is case-sensitive.

   * **Amazon Redshift**:

      * In the Amazon Redshift server, all the identifiers are case-sensitive if the configuration is set as:

      ```bash
         enable_case_sensitive_identifier=true
      ```
      {: codeblock}


      * In the Amazon Redshift server, only lowercase identifiers are fetched if the configuration is set as:

      ```bash
         enable_case_sensitive_identifier=false
      ```
      {: codeblock}

   * **SQL Server**:

     * Enable case-sensitive collation in the SQL Server to create duplicate tables in mixed-case.

## Mixed-case feature flag: OFF
{: #flagoff_features}

The following section lists the behaviors of connectors if mixed-case feature flag is set to OFF:

   * **MariaDB**:

     * Table and schema names should be in uppercase.

   * **Greenplum**:

     * Table and schema names should be in lowercase.

   * **IBM {{site.data.keyword.netezza_short}}**:

     * Schema name for `USE` statement is case-sensitive if you use it before `CREATE VIEW` statement.

   * **Db2**:

     * Schema name for `USE` statement is case-sensitive if you use it before `CREATE VIEW` statement.
